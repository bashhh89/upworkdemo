### AI Efficiency Scorecard (Updated)

Curious about how ready you are to leverage AI effectively? The AI Efficiency Scorecard has been updated to provide a more comprehensive assessment. By answering a series of questions across key areas like strategy, data, tools, and team skills, you'll receive a personalized score and detailed report, including recommendations tailored to your readiness level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced). It's a great way to identify your strengths and pinpoint areas for improvement on your AI journey. You can easily restart the scorecard to track your progress over time.

### Executive Persona Analyzer

Understanding who you're communicating with is key. This tool helps you generate AI-powered insights into the personality and communication style of executives. By simply entering an executive's name and company, the AI analyzes publicly available information to create a comprehensive profile.

The generated profile provides a summary, insights into their likely communication preferences, actionable tips for engaging effectively, a breakdown of their potential DISC profile (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness), and insights tailored to different business contexts like sales, meetings, and negotiations. You can also **save generated profiles and get a unique, shareable link** to easily share the insights with others.

This tool is valuable for anyone looking to tailor their communication for better results.

### Deep Research

Need in-depth information on a complex topic? The Deep Research tool helps you get comprehensive answers by breaking down your query into smaller research tasks. It can:

Instead of navigating to a specific tool section, you can simply mention the tool you want to use and provide the necessary information within your conversation with the AI assistant. The project is designed to understand your request and run the tool for you, showing you the results right there in the chat or providing a link to the full result.

## For Technical Handover (Developer to Developer)

This project is a web application built primarily using **Next.js** (a React framework) and **TypeScript**.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Framework:** Next.js (React)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Likely Tailwind CSS (based on utility class names like `flex`, `gap`, `p-6`, `bg-[#0a0a0a]`, etc., and the `cn` utility import)
*   **UI Components:** Utilizes custom components (`SidebarNav`, `KanbanColumn`, etc.) and potentially a UI library (suggested by `src/components/ui/`).
*   **API Routes:** Includes API routes (`src/app/api/`) for handling server-side logic and interactions, likely including external AI service integrations (e.g., `/api/chat`, `/api/pollinations/`).

**Project Structure:**

*   `src/app/`: Contains the main application pages and API routes. `page.tsx` serves as the central hub, routing to different "sections".
*   `src/app/sections/`: Houses components representing different features or tools within the application (e.g., `ChatSection`, `ImageGeneratorSection`, `WebsiteScraperSection`, `KanbanSection`).
*   `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components used across the application, including a `ui/` subdirectory which might contain components from a UI library like Shadcn UI or similar.
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and libraries (`utils.ts`, `pollinations-api.ts`).
*   `public/`: Static assets.
*   Configuration files like `next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` (or `package-lock.json`) manage the project's build, dependencies, and configuration.

**Architecture:**

The application follows a typical Next.js architecture with client-side rendering and server-side capabilities via API routes. The main `Home` component in `src/app/page.tsx` acts as a dynamic router, rendering different section components based on the user's selection from the sidebar navigation. State management appears to be handled locally within components using React's `useState` hook.

To run the project:

1.  Ensure Node.js and pnpm (or npm/yarn) are installed.
2.  Install dependencies using `pnpm install` (or `npm install` / `yarn install`).
3.  Run the development server using `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`).
4.  Build the project using `pnpm build` (or `npm run build` / `yarn build`).

Further exploration of the `src/app/api/` routes and the section components within `src/app/sections/` is recommended to understand the specific AI integrations and business logic.

### Chat Section (`src/app/sections/ChatSection.tsx`)

This component forms the core chat interface. It manages the state of chat threads (`threads`, `activeThreadId`, `messages`), handles user input, and facilitates communication with the backend API (`/api/pollinations`) for generating AI responses using various models (`pollinationsModels`).

Key features and functionalities implemented include:

*   **Thread Management:** Creating, selecting, deleting, and renaming chat threads, with persistence via `localStorage`.
*   **Message Display:** Renders chat messages, supporting Markdown formatting and highlighting code blocks. Code blocks include copy-to-clipboard and preview functionality.
*   **Tool Integration:**
    *   Detects tool requests in natural language using `detectAndExecuteTool`.
    *   Handles pending tool parameter input via `pendingTool` state and `renderToolParamForm`.
    *   Invokes specialized tools using `executeSpecializedTool` which interacts with specific API endpoints (`/api/tools/...`).
    *   Displays tool results within the chat thread using summaries and links to full result pages, and includes the "Ask About This" feature.
*   **Artifact and Tool Result Libraries:** Manages the state of saved code artifacts (`savedArtifacts`) and tool results (`savedToolResults`) with persistence in `localStorage`. Includes functionality to save, delete, and load artifacts, and display tool results in a browsable library.
*   **Model Selection:** Allows users to select different AI models via a dropdown, fetching available models from an external API (`https://text.pollinations.ai/models`).
*   **UI Elements:** Utilizes various UI components for input, buttons, tooltips, cards, and message rendering.

The component also includes logic for scrolling to the latest message, handling clipboard operations, and displaying loading/typing indicators.

### Critique Section (`src/app/sections/CritiqueSection.tsx`)

This section implements the "AI Marketing Critique" tool. It provides a text area for the user to input a description of their marketing challenge, strategy, or campaign.

The component sends this user input to the `/api/pollinations` backend endpoint. It uses a specific system prompt tailored to instruct the AI (configured to use the `openai` model in the code) to act as a direct yet constructive marketing consultant. The AI's task is to analyze the user's input and provide critical feedback, highlighting key weaknesses, missed opportunities, or strategic flaws, along with high-level suggestions for improvement.

The AI's generated critique is then displayed within the section. The component handles the loading state during the API call, displays any errors that occur, and utilizes a toast notification for basic input validation.

### Executive Persona Section (`src/app/sections/ExecutivePersonaSection.tsx`)

This section implements the "Executive Persona Analyzer" tool. It features a form that takes two inputs: the executive's name and their company name.

Upon submission, the component sends a request to the `/api/pollinations` backend endpoint, utilizing the `searchgpt` model. The system prompt is designed to instruct the AI to find publicly available information about the executive and company, with a focus on inferring their professional communication style and personality traits based *only* on this public data.

The expected AI response is a JSON object containing a comprehensive personality profile, which includes:

*   A summary of key career points and focus areas.
*   An inferred communication style.
*   Actionable communication tips.
*   Preferences and traits with scoring (e.g., data orientation, risk tolerance).
*   Likely related business topics of interest.
*   A detailed DISC personality profile assessment, including primary/secondary types, description, strengths, challenges, and a numerical breakdown of DISC components.
*   Contextual insights tailored for different business interactions (sales, meetings, negotiations, presentations, email).

The component displays the generated profile in a tabbed interface, organizing the information into sections like Overview, DISC Profile, Communication, and Contexts. It includes functionality to copy the raw JSON data of the profile or download the profile as a text report. Error handling and a progress indicator are also implemented.

### Ideal Customer Profile Section (`src/app/sections/IdealCustomerProfileSection.tsx`)

This section implements the "Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Generator" tool. It allows users to provide details about their existing successful customers (company name, contact name, and optional fields for LinkedIn URL, website URL, and notes) and information about their own company (name and industry).

The component processes this input and sends it to the `/api/pollinations` backend endpoint, leveraging the `searchgpt` model. The AI is prompted to analyze the provided customer examples to identify common characteristics and synthesize a detailed Ideal Customer Profile. The report generated includes:

*   A persona profile describing the ideal customer archetype.
*   Prospecting parameters, such as relevant job titles, industries, company size, online communities, content interests, technographics, and search keywords.
*   Engagement strategies, offering messaging tips, key motivators, decision triggers, objection handling suggestions, and sample outreach templates for email, LinkedIn, and cold calls.
*   Generated visual concepts (image URLs) for a persona image, LinkedIn template, and email header template, created using the `image.pollinations.ai` service based on the ICP details.

The results are presented to the user through a tabbed interface within the section, allowing for organized viewing of the Persona, Prospecting, Engagement, and Visuals sections. Users can copy specific text elements (like templates) or download the complete report as a text file. The component also manages the dynamic addition/removal of customer input fields, displays a loading state with progress, and handles potential errors.

### Image Generator Section (`src/app/sections/ImageGeneratorSection.tsx`)

This section provides a simple interface for generating images using AI, specifically via the `image.pollinations.ai` service. Users input a text prompt describing the desired image.

The component constructs a URL for the `image.pollinations.ai` API, encoding the user's prompt and including parameters for width, height, a unique seed for variation, and disabling the default logo. Setting this URL as the `src` of an `<img>` tag triggers the image generation and loading directly from the third-party service in the browser.

The generated image is displayed within the section. The component includes visual indicators for the loading state and handles potential errors that may occur during the image loading process (e.g., if the generation fails or the URL is invalid) by displaying an error message and a placeholder image.

### Kanban Section (`src/app/sections/KanbanSection.tsx`)

This section implements a versatile Kanban board for visual task and lead management. It is built using `@dnd-kit` for drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to easily move tasks between columns.

Key features include:

*   **Multiple Pipelines:** Supports the creation and management of different Kanban pipelines (e.g., Task Management, Sales Leads). The component initializes with mock data for a "Task Management" pipeline (To Do, In Progress, Done) and a "[Planned]" "Sales Leads" pipeline.
*   **Customizable Stages:** While the initial stages are defined in mock data, the component includes integration with a `PipelineCustomizationModal` component (`src/components/pipeline-customization-modal.tsx`), suggesting planned functionality for users to define their own pipeline stages.
*   **Task Detail Modal:** Clicking on a task opens a `KanbanTaskDetailModal` (`src/components/kanban-task-detail-modal.tsx`) to view and potentially edit task details (though editing functionality is not fully evident in the provided code snippet).
*   **AI Task Generation:** For the "Task Management" pipeline, users can provide a goal, and the component will call the `/api/pollinations` endpoint (using the `openai` model with a specific prompt for JSON output) to generate a list of actionable tasks with phases and priorities, which are then added to the board. This feature is currently limited to the "Task Management" pipeline.
*   **Persistence:** State for pipelines and tasks is managed using React's `useState` and `useMemo` for performance, but currently lacks client-side persistence (e.g., via `localStorage`) or backend integration for saving/loading data across sessions.

The component utilizes various UI components for input, buttons, selects, and modals. The drag-and-drop logic (`handleDragStart`, `handleDragOver`, `handleDragEnd`) is implemented to handle moving tasks between stages within the active pipeline, as well as potentially between different pipelines/stages (though drag over column titles within the active pipeline is explicitly handled).

### Objection Handler Section (`src/app/sections/ObjectionHandlerSection.tsx`)

This section implements an "AI Objection Handler" tool designed to help users practice handling objections from various simulated personas.

Key features include:

*   **Multiple Personas:** Users can select from predefined AI personas (e.g., Skeptical Client, Business Roaster, Venture Capitalist) each with a specific communication style and objective for raising objections.
*   **Custom Persona:** The ability to define a custom persona with a user-provided system prompt and welcome message.
*   **Text and Speech Interaction:** Users interact via a text-based chat interface. AI responses can optionally be converted to speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
*   **Pollinations.ai Integration:** The component utilizes the `/api/pollinations` endpoint for generating AI text responses based on the selected persona's system prompt and the conversation history. It also uses the `/api/pollinations/audio` endpoint for TTS conversion, supporting various voices provided by Pollinations.ai.
*   **Conversation Progress:** Tracks basic conversation progress, including the number of exchanges, successfully addressed objections (based on simple pattern matching in AI responses), and the current streak of successful responses.
*   **UI Components:** Leverages various UI components for persona and voice selection, text input, buttons, progress display, and modal dialogues for custom persona settings.

The component manages the conversation state, loading states, and error handling. It uses `localStorage` for basic persistence of conversation history (though this may need further consideration for larger histories or multi-user scenarios).

### Roadmap Section (`src/app/sections/RoadmapSection.tsx`)

This section implements a "Strategic 90-Day AI Roadmap". It is a front-end component (`RoadmapSection.tsx`) that provides users with a structured, interactive guide for implementing AI, broken down into three distinct phases: Audit & Foundation (Days 1-30), Deploy (Days 31-60), and Optimize & Scale (Days 61-90). The roadmap is presented using Accordion components, allowing users to expand each phase and its associated activities to reveal detailed action items, recommendations, tips, and key questions for successful AI integration. This component serves as a static informational resource presented in a dynamic UI.

The component then categorizes the score (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and displays a detailed report including key findings, next steps, a checklist, and AI tool suggestions. This report is generated by making an API call to the backend (`/api/pollinations`) with the user's assessment answers as context. The component manages the assessment state (current question, answers, score, report) using local React state and adheres to the specified "Ahmad Basheer Style Guide" for styling. It provides navigation buttons to move between questions and a "Start Over" button to reset the assessment.

### Generator Section (`src/app/sections/GeneratorSection.tsx`)
### Scorecard Section (V3) (`src/app/sections/ScorecardSectionV3.tsx`)

This section implements the latest version of the "AI Efficiency Scorecard". It is a front-end component (`ScorecardSectionV3.tsx`) that dynamically generates assessment questions based on the user's previous answers by making API calls to the backend (`/api/pollinations`). The component guides the user through this dynamic question flow, collecting answers using various input types. Upon completion of a set number of questions, it calculates an AI readiness score percentage and readiness category (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced). It then generates a comprehensive, personalized report by making another API call to the backend, which analyzes all the user's answers to provide:

*   Key Findings: A summary of strengths and weaknesses.
*   Next Steps: Prioritized action items for improvement.
*   Checklist: Immediate, actionable tasks.
*   Tool Suggestions: Recommendations for specific AI tools, categories, or approaches relevant to the user's responses.

The component manages the state of the dynamic questions, user answers, score, and the AI-generated report using local React state. It includes UI elements for navigation (next/previous questions), displaying loading states, handling errors during API calls, and presenting the detailed report. It also incorporates interactive elements for copying prompt templates and marking checklist items as complete. This version represents a significant enhancement by providing a more personalized assessment and a richer, AI-driven report.
### Scorecard Tabs (`src/app/sections/ScorecardTabs.tsx`)

This component acts as a container and provides a tabbed interface for the different versions of the AI Efficiency Scorecard. It manages the active tab state, allowing users to switch between the "Standard Assessment" (which renders the `ScorecardSectionV2` component) and the "Dynamic AI Assessment" (which renders the `ScorecardSectionV3` component). It also includes a brief informational box explaining the difference between the two assessment types to the user. This component is likely the primary entry point for accessing the Scorecard functionality.
### Talk To Website Section (`src/app/sections/TalkToWebsiteSection.tsx`)

This component provides the "Talk To Website AI" functionality, enabling users to have a conversational interaction about the content of a specified website. It takes a website URL as input and uses a backend API (`/api/scraper`) to fetch and process the website's content. Once the content is analyzed, it presents a chat interface where users can ask questions. User questions and the analyzed website context are sent to another backend API endpoint (`/api/pollinations`, specifically utilizing the `searchgpt` model) to generate AI responses based *only* on the website's information. The component manages the state for the input URL, the analyzed website data, and the chat messages. It displays the website's basic information (title, description, URL) and renders the chat conversation. Loading states and error messages are handled during the analysis and messaging processes.

*   The full generated proposal content, rendered using a simple Markdown parser with heading-based navigation.
*   A shareable URL (`/shared/tool-result/[id]`) that links to a standalone page displaying just the proposal content.

The component manages the form state, loading indicators, error display, and user interaction for navigation within the generated proposal and copying the shareable link.

### AI Brand Foundation Section (`src/app/sections/BrandFoundationSection.tsx`)

This section implements a multi-step form to collect brand information from the user. Upon submission, it leverages the `/api/pollinations` endpoint, specifically utilizing the `searchgpt` model, to perform a detailed brand analysis. The analysis generates various components of a brand identity, including vision/mission statements, messaging pillars with topic suggestions, brand keywords, and suggested color palettes (with hex codes).

Additionally, this section integrates with the `image.pollinations.ai` service to generate image URLs for logo concepts and social media templates based on the generated brand elements. The results are presented to the user within the section itself through a tabbed interface, allowing users to view different aspects of the brand report and offering options to copy text elements or download the complete report as a text file. Error handling and progress indication are also implemented within this section.

### Resources Section (`src/app/sections/ResourcesSection.tsx`)

This section is currently a placeholder component (`ResourcesSection.tsx`) for a future feature. The planned functionality is to provide a curated list of helpful AI resources and tools to the user.

### Enhanced Tooling Architecture

The project incorporates several components and patterns for a structured and user-friendly tool interaction experience.

### Tool Result Display and Management

Result display is primarily managed by the `src/app/shared/tool-result/[id]/page.tsx` component for detailed views and `src/components/ToolResultSummary.tsx` for inline chat previews.

*   **`src/app/shared/tool-result/[id]/page.tsx`:** Renders full tool results with dedicated display logic for `Website Intelligence Scanner`, `Executive Persona`, and `Contextual Deal Writer`. It includes features like expandable content and integrates the "Ask About This" functionality, allowing users to initiate a new chat thread with the result context. Results are fetched from `localStorage` based on the ID in the URL.
*   **`src/components/ToolResultSummary.tsx`:** Provides a compact, visually appealing summary of a tool result within the chat thread, including the tool name, summary, date, and actions like "View Details" and "Share".
*   **Persistence:** Tool results are saved client-side in `localStorage` via the `saveToolResult` function (`src/lib/tool-utils.ts`) and retrieved by `getSavedToolResults`. Each result is assigned a unique ID (`uuidv4`) enabling persistent, shareable URLs (`/shared/tool-result/[id]`) allowing direct access to a specific result.
*   **Tool Invocation Interface:**

User interaction with tools is facilitated through multiple interfaces integrated within the chat:

*   **Slash Commands:** The `SlashCommandMenu.tsx` component likely handles the display and selection of tools when the user types "/".
*   **Tool Button Tray:** The `ToolButtonTray.tsx` component provides quick access to tools via clickable buttons.
*   **Form Handling:** Specialized components like `ExecutivePersonaForm.tsx`, `WebsiteScannerForm.tsx`, and `DealWriterForm.tsx` provide tailored, well-designed user interfaces for inputting tool parameters. The generic `ToolParametersForm.tsx` might still be used for tools without a dedicated form.
*   **Chat Message Parsing:** The `detectToolRequest` and `extractParametersFromMessage` functions in `src/lib/tool-utils.ts` enable natural language tool invocation from chat messages.

The `EnhancedThread.tsx` component likely orchestrates the display of chat messages, tool summaries, forms, and the integration of the slash command menu and tool button tray.

### Tool Definitions

Tool metadata, including names, descriptions, trigger phrases, required parameters, and API endpoints, is defined in the `availableTools` array within `src/lib/tool-utils.ts`. This centralized definition is crucial for tool detection, parameter extraction, and form generation.

The "Tool Results Library" is implemented via the `ToolResultsLibrary.tsx` component, which fetches saved results using the `getSavedToolResults` function from `src/lib/tool-utils.ts`. Results are stored client-side in the browser's `localStorage` using the `saveToolResult` function, keyed under 'toolResults'. Each saved result has a unique ID generated by `uuidv4`, which is used to create a shareable URL (`/shared/tool-result/[id]`) allowing direct access to a specific result.

### Chat Integration and Tool Invocation

The project integrates tool usage directly within the chat interface. The `detectToolRequest` function in `src/lib/tool-utils.ts` analyzes incoming chat messages for predefined trigger phrases associated with available tools (`availableTools` array). If a tool is detected, the `extractParametersFromMessage` function attempts to parse necessary parameters from the message content. The `hasAllRequiredParameters` function then verifies if the extracted parameters are sufficient to invoke the tool. This allows users to interact with specialized AI tools conversationally. The results are then formatted for chat display using `formatToolResultForChat`, which includes a summary and a link to the full result page.
