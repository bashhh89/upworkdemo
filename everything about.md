# Project Overview Report

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the project's features, architecture, and current state, including notes on missing or incomplete areas.

## Project Structure

The project is a Next.js application using the app directory structure. Key directories include:
- `src/app`: Contains pages and API routes.
- `src/app/sections`: Houses various components representing different sections or features of the application.
- `public`: Stores static assets like images.
- `src/components/ui`: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the app.
- `src/lib`: Contains utility functions supporting the application.

The main entry point is `src/app/page.tsx`, which manages navigation between different feature sections using a sidebar navigation component.

## Project Purpose and Architecture

This project is designed as an AI-powered platform to assist users with marketing and sales AI readiness, idea generation, voiceover creation, objection handling, and more. It leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and React for client-side interactivity. The app is structured into modular sections, each representing a distinct feature or tool, with a consistent dark-themed UI.

## Features Overview

### Roadmap Section (`src/app/sections/RoadmapSection.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** Displays a static, interactive 90-day AI implementation roadmap divided into three phases: Audit & Foundation, Deploy, and Optimize & Scale. Each phase contains collapsible activities revealing detailed action items, examples, and recommendations.
- **Current State:** Fully structured and visually functional using Accordion components.
- **Missing/Incomplete:** Contains placeholder text such as `[Example Use Case]`, `[Template Idea]`, and `[Checklist Item]`. The roadmap is static and does not dynamically link to integrated tools or track user progress.

### AI Idea Generator (`src/app/sections/GeneratorSection.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** Intended as an interactive AI idea generation tool.
- **Current State:** Placeholder UI only; the interactive tool is yet to be implemented.

### ROI Calculator (`src/app/sections/RoiSection.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** Designed to provide an interactive ROI calculation tool for AI initiatives.
- **Current State:** Placeholder UI only; the calculator functionality is pending implementation.

### Resource List (`src/app/sections/ResourcesSection.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** Curated list of AI resources and tools.
- **Current State:** Placeholder UI only; content and interactivity are to be developed.

### AI Voiceover Generator (`src/app/sections/VoiceoverGeneratorSection.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** Allows users to input text and select from multiple AI voices to generate audio voiceovers using an external API (`https://text.pollinations.ai/openai`).
- **Current State:** Fully implemented with text input, voice selection, audio generation, error handling, and audio playback.

### AI Efficiency Scorecard (`src/app/sections/ScorecardSectionV2.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** A comprehensive AI readiness assessment tool with approximately 20 questions across categories such as Strategy & Goals, Data Readiness, Tool Adoption, Team Skills, and Process Integration.
- **Current State:** Fully implemented with a step-by-step UI, input handling, scoring logic, AI-generated detailed reports, recommendations, and options to download or share results.
- **Technical Details:** Uses Shadcn UI components for cards, buttons, radio groups, and progress bars. Integrates with an AI API to generate personalized reports based on user responses.

### AI Conversation Practice - Objection Handler (`src/app/sections/ObjectionHandlerSection.tsx`)
- **Functionality:** Enables users to practice handling objections and feedback through AI-driven conversations with selectable personas such as Skeptical Client, Business Roaster, Venture Capitalist, and Custom Persona.
- **Current State:** Fully implemented with text input, AI response generation, audio playback of responses, persona customization, and progress tracking with a persuasiveness score.
- **Technical Details:** Integrates with Pollinations API for AI responses and text-to-speech audio generation. Supports audio controls and transcription display.

## Additional Features and Components

- **Sidebar Navigation (`src/components/SidebarNav.tsx`):** Manages navigation between different sections of the app.
- **Reusable UI Components (`src/components/ui`):** Includes buttons, cards, inputs, selects, toasts, and other UI elements styled consistently with the dark theme.
- **API Routes (`src/app/api`):** Contains backend API routes for AI services such as audio generation and image generation, interfacing with external AI providers.

## Summary of Missing or Incomplete Features

- Several sections such as the AI Idea Generator, ROI Calculator, and Resource List are currently placeholders awaiting full implementation.
- The Roadmap Section, while visually complete, lacks dynamic integration with other tools and progress tracking.
- Some UI components referenced in imports are missing or have incorrect paths, which may require fixing.

## How Features Work - Technical Overview

- The app uses Next.js app directory routing with React functional components.
- State management is primarily handled with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- AI interactions are performed via fetch calls to external APIs (Pollinations and OpenAI).
- Audio generation and playback are integrated with browser APIs and custom hooks.
- The UI follows a consistent dark theme with Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- The Scorecard feature includes complex logic for scoring, categorization, and generating AI-driven reports.
- The Objection Handler feature supports multiple AI personas with customizable system prompts and conversational state management.
